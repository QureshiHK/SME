imageFolderSort.py takes the pre-z slice characters of file name in image sequence (outputted by imageJ save as image sequence function) and creates folders pre time point. To make it work, you need to modify the 3 character qualifier (in the final for loop) to the first 3 characters of the image files.

moveFile2CorFold.py takes the various image files and sorts them into the timepoint folders created by imageFolderSort.py. Shouldn't need to change anything for this. As ImageJ exports z slices per time point in the 'save as image sequence' function, the suffix is typically t001_z001.tif, meaning the Z slice identifier is always 9 characters, and anything preceeding the final 9 characters in the timepoint specific prefix

bracketrename is a script to sort raw unsorted zeiss z1 lightsheet output file series (.czi). The problem is that the time points are saved to individual .czi files and are not referencable by a master file. This script puts brackets around the suffix numbers denoting their position in the time series. If such a file does not exist, you can generate a master file which will point to all these now sorted files (which have been given brackets). The masterfile simply is a .czi file which carries the same name as all the time series files (which you just sorted), but it lacks a suffix. This can be created by copying a random time point file and removing the number suffix. Opening this file in zen or ImageJ will open all of the time points in the appropriate series.
To get this script to work, change the value of 'presuffixLen' to how many characters there are before the numerical suffix which denotes which time point a particular .czi file is referring to.
